## What This Project Solves

Sales and recruitment teams lose significant time reaching out to stale contacts. When a prospect has changed roles or left a company, outbound messages bounce or land with the wrong person — damaging response rates and wasting pipeline. Manually checking LinkedIn for dozens or hundreds of contacts is slow and inconsistent at scale.

**StillThere** automates this verification using publicly available web evidence. Given a person's name, company, and optional email, the system runs a four-stage pipeline: it queries the web through the Serper API, scrapes the most relevant pages, passes the collected text to the Claude API for structured extraction, and scores the results deterministically. The output is five independently sourced binary signals — *Person Found Online*, *Associated With Company*, *Found on Company Website*, *Company Active*, *Email Match* — each backed by a cited URL and the model's reasoning.

The design is deliberately conservative: the system returns **Unclear** when evidence is insufficient rather than guessing. Every result is auditable because every conclusion traces back to a specific web page.

The platform supports two workflows:

| Workflow | Description |
|---|---|
| **Single Verification** | Enter a name, company, and optional email → receive an evidence-backed report within 20–90 seconds |
| **Batch CSV Upload** | Upload a CSV of contacts → background processing with a live progress dashboard and CSV export |

## Engineering Highlights

- **Async pipeline decoupled from HTTP** — Celery workers process each verification in the background; the API returns HTTP 202 immediately with a job ID. The client polls until complete. This decouples response latency from pipeline runtime and enables batch fan-out to N parallel tasks.

- **Event loop isolation in Celery workers** — Celery tasks each call `asyncio.run()`, creating a new event loop per execution. asyncpg connections from a shared pool are bound to the loop that created them, causing `"Future attached to a different loop"` errors at scale. The fix: a dedicated `NullPool` SQLAlchemy engine used exclusively by task code, ensuring fresh connections per task invocation.

- **LLM-structured evidence extraction** — Claude receives the raw text of each scraped page and returns a structured JSON object identifying which of the five evidence signals the page supports, with verbatim quotes and reasoning per signal. This handles the variety of web page formats that rules-based extraction cannot.

- **Evidence-first result model** — Five independent tri-state signals (Yes / No / Unclear). The confidence score is computed deterministically from field determination and source quality — no ML inference in the scoring layer. Unclear signals do not count as evidence either way.

- **Batch CSV fan-out with atomic progress** — A batch job pre-creates all database records before dispatching N Celery tasks. Each row task atomically increments shared counters on the parent job. Progress is visible in real time via polling.

- **Redis-based per-user rate limiting** — Daily quotas (5 verifications / 1 guest / 2 batch uploads) are enforced via Redis `INCR` + `EXPIREAT` pipeline counters. Authenticated users are keyed by user ID; guests by SHA-256-hashed IP (so raw IPs are never stored). The service is fail-open: if Redis is unavailable, requests pass through rather than blocking legitimate users.

- **Admin panel with cross-user visibility** — An `is_admin` flag on the User model gates a `GET /api/v1/admin/verifications` endpoint that returns all verifications across every account, including the submitting user's email (or `null` for guests). A dedicated `AdminRoute` component guards the frontend `/admin` page, redirecting non-admins to `/` rather than exposing a 403.

- **LinkedIn profile URL filtering** — The LLM prompt explicitly prohibits returning company page URLs (`linkedin.com/company/…`) as the LinkedIn Profile link. A `field_validator` on `LLMAnalysisResult` strips any LinkedIn URL that does not contain `/in/`, providing a second layer of defence against model hallucination.

- **Refresh token security design** — Refresh tokens are 512-bit random hex strings (128 characters); only the SHA-256 hash is stored in the database so a compromised token table cannot be reversed. Tokens are single-use — every `/refresh` call issues a new pair and revokes the old one. Re-using a spent token is treated as a theft indicator and triggers revocation of *all* active sessions for that user (session-family revocation). The `token_issued_before` column on `User` invalidates all outstanding access tokens when a user changes their password, closing the gap between credential change and token expiry.

- **Timing-attack prevention on login** — `AuthService.login()` always runs a bcrypt comparison regardless of whether the email exists, using a precomputed `_DUMMY_HASH`. Without this, an attacker could distinguish "email not found" from "wrong password" by response time, enabling account enumeration (CWE-203). The dummy compare equalises both paths to approximately one bcrypt round-trip.

- **SQLAlchemy 2.x enum binding** — SQLAlchemy 2.x with `native_enum=False` binds enum `.name` (uppercase) by default, not `.value`. Database check constraints were created with lowercase values. The non-obvious fix — `values_callable=lambda x: [e.value for e in x]` on every `SAEnum` declaration — must be applied to every enum column and fails silently at definition time; the error only surfaces as a `CheckViolationError` at insert time.

- **asyncpg URL sanitisation** — Neon (and other managed PostgreSQL providers) issue libpq-style connection strings with `sslmode=require&channel_binding=require`. The asyncpg driver rejects both parameters. A `field_validator` on `DATABASE_URL` strips all libpq-only query parameters and re-adds `ssl=require` when SSL was originally requested, making the URL transparently compatible with asyncpg without requiring manual editing.

- **Circuit breakers on external calls** — `serper_breaker` and `anthropic_breaker` are module-level singletons (CLOSED → OPEN → auto-reset) that stop cascading failures when the Serper or Anthropic APIs become unresponsive. The breakers trip after a configurable failure threshold and hold OPEN for a configurable reset window, allowing the upstream service time to recover before retrying. Both are reset between tests via an `autouse` conftest fixture to prevent state leakage.

- **Savepoint-based test isolation** — Integration tests run inside a connection-level transaction. `session.commit()` calls create savepoints (via SQLAlchemy 2.x `join_transaction_mode="create_savepoint"`) rather than committing the outer transaction. `connection.rollback()` at teardown undoes all changes without any DDL between tests.

## Architecture

```
Browser  →  Vite dev proxy (/api → backend:8000)  →  FastAPI
                                                        ├─ Routes        (HTTP only — no logic)
                                                        ├─ Services      (business logic, own the session)
                                                        ├─ Repositories  (all DB queries)
                                                        └─ Celery dispatch
                                                                ↓ Redis broker

                                                                ├─ httpx + BS4 (page scraping)
                                                                └─ Claude API  (evidence extraction)
                                                                        ↓
PostgreSQL  ←───────────────── single source of truth ──────────────────┘
     Redis  ←───────────────── ephemeral only (broker, cache, results)
```

The application is a **layered monolith**. Routes are kept intentionally thin — they validate the incoming request, instantiate a service, call one method, and return the response. All business logic lives in the service layer, which owns the database session and coordinates across multiple repositories within a single transaction. Repositories perform all SQL queries; nothing else touches SQLAlchemy directly.

Celery sits alongside FastAPI rather than inside it. When a route dispatches a verification task, it writes a `PENDING` result row to PostgreSQL and returns HTTP 202 immediately. The worker picks up the job from Redis, runs the four-stage pipeline, and writes results back to PostgreSQL. The client discovers completion by polling `GET /api/v1/verifications/{id}` every two seconds.

**PostgreSQL is the single source of truth.** Redis is strictly ephemeral: Celery broker, result backend, and HTTP cache only. Losing Redis does not lose data — the API falls back gracefully if Redis is unavailable.

---

## Verification Pipeline

Each verification runs a deterministic four-stage pipeline inside a Celery worker. The pipeline is idempotent: if a task crashes mid-run and is re-queued, it detects the partial state, discards any incomplete evidence, and restarts cleanly.

### Stage 1 — Search

`SearchService` fires 3–4 concurrent queries through the Serper API (programmatic Google results):

| Query type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `"Name" "Company"` | Broad person-company association |
| `site:linkedin.com "Name" "Company"` | LinkedIn profile presence |
| `"Company" official site` | Company homepage and trading status |
| `"email@domain"` *(optional)* | Email address presence check |

Results from all queries are merged and deduplicated by URL. The raw Serper JSON is stored on the `Search` record for audit purposes.

### Stage 2 — Scrape

`EvidenceService` fetches each unique URL asynchronously using `httpx`. Pages are parsed with BeautifulSoup4 to extract clean body text, stripping navigation, scripts, and advertisements. Up to 20 sources are collected per verification. Each source is classified by type (`professional_profile`, `company_website`, `business_directory`, `search_result`, `other`) based on domain pattern matching — this classification feeds directly into the confidence score.

### Stage 3 — LLM Analysis

Each page's text is sent to the Claude API with a structured prompt. Claude is asked to identify which of the five evidence signals the page supports, to quote the specific text that led to each conclusion, and to return a structured JSON object. The service parses and validates the JSON, discarding malformed responses.

Claude is explicitly instructed to return `unclear` for any signal where the page is ambiguous or silent — it is never asked to infer or guess. This uncertainty propagates directly to the result.

### Stage 4 — Confidence Scoring

`ConfidenceService` computes a 0–100 score from two independent components:

**Field determination (0–50 pts):** 10 points for each of the five signals that has a definite outcome (`yes` or `no`). A signal left as `unclear` contributes 0. This rewards breadth of evidence coverage.

**Source quality (0–50 pts, capped):** a sum of per-source weights based on the source type assigned in Stage 2:

| Source type | Weight |
|---|---|
| Professional profile (LinkedIn, Xing…) | 12 |
| Company website | 10 |
| Business directory | 7 |
| Search result | 5 |
| Other | 3 |

The total maps to a confidence level: **High** (≥70), **Medium** (40–69), **Low** (<40). No machine learning is involved — the algorithm is fully deterministic and auditable.

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Alternative Considered | Reason for This Choice |
|---|---|---|
| **Celery for async verification** | Synchronous endpoint with long-polling | Avoids HTTP gateway timeouts (pipeline runs 20–90 s). Enables batch fan-out to N parallel tasks without blocking the API server. |
| **Serper.dev for web search** | Scraping Google search results directly | Structured JSON API with predictable rate limits. Avoids Google's Terms of Service restrictions on automated scraping. 2,500 free searches per month covers the target use case. |
| **Claude API for evidence extraction** | Regex / CSS-selector heuristics | Unstructured web text resists rules-based parsing — page layouts, copy, and structure vary too widely. The LLM handles variation naturally and can express uncertainty (`unclear`) when a page is ambiguous, which a regex cannot. |
| **NullPool for Celery workers** | Shared `QueuePool` (same engine as the API) | Each `asyncio.run()` call in a Celery task creates a new event loop. asyncpg connections are bound to the loop that created them. Reusing pooled connections across different loops raises `"Future attached to a different loop"` at runtime. `NullPool` creates a fresh connection per task invocation, eliminating the loop mismatch entirely. |
| **Five independent tri-state signals** | Single composite confidence percentage | Individual signals are auditable and actionable. A user can see *why* a result is uncertain — the person was found online but not on the company website — rather than receiving a percentage with no explanation. |
| **Layered monolith over microservices** | Separate services for search, scraping, and analysis | Simpler deployment, single transactional boundary, and explicit layer contracts. The separation could be extracted to services later with minimal refactoring. |
| **`values_callable` on all SQLAlchemy enums** | Default `SAEnum` with `native_enum=False` | SQLAlchemy 2.x binds enum `.name` (e.g. `"PENDING"`) rather than `.value` (e.g. `"pending"`). Database check constraints use lowercase values. Without `values_callable`, every enum insert raises a `CheckViolationError` that is invisible until that code path is exercised. |
| **Savepoint-based test isolation** | Truncating tables between tests | Each integration test runs inside a connection-level transaction. `session.commit()` calls produce savepoints, not real commits. `connection.rollback()` at teardown undoes everything with no DDL overhead between tests. |

## Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stillthere.git
cd stillthere

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and SERPER_API_KEY at minimum

# 3. Start all services
docker compose up --build

# 4. Run database migrations
docker compose exec backend alembic upgrade head

# Services:
#   Frontend:        http://localhost:5173
#   API + Swagger:   http://localhost:8000/api/docs
#   Flower (tasks):  http://localhost:5555
```

> **OneDrive note:** Volume mounts (`./backend:/app`) are unreliable on OneDrive paths. Always pass `--build` so code changes are baked into the image.

The `contact_verification_test` database is created automatically when the PostgreSQL volume is first initialised. If you already have an existing volume, create it manually:

```bash
docker compose exec db psql -U cvp_user -c "CREATE DATABASE contact_verification_test;"
```

---

## Local Development

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

docker compose up db redis -d   # start only the dependencies

alembic upgrade head
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev   # Vite dev server on :5173, proxies /api to localhost:8000
```

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes | Claude API key — [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |
| `SERPER_API_KEY` | Yes | Google Search API key — [serper.dev](https://serper.dev) (2,500 free/month) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Yes | JWT signing secret — minimum 32 characters. Generate: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"` |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | Yes | PostgreSQL username (default: `cvp_user`) |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Yes | PostgreSQL password |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | Yes | Main database name (default: `contact_verification`) |
| `REDIS_URL` | Yes | Redis connection string (default: `redis://redis:6379/0`) |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | No | **JSON array string**: `["http://localhost:5173"]` — not comma-separated |
| `DEBUG` | No | `true` enables verbose logging and auto-migration on startup |

`DATABASE_URL` is composed automatically from the `POSTGRES_*` variables inside `docker-compose.yml` for local development. In production (Render), set it manually to the Neon external connection string — the `fix_database_url` validator strips libpq-only parameters automatically.

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for all available variables and defaults.

## Running Tests

```bash
cd backend

# Unit tests — no database required
pytest tests/unit/ --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing

# Integration tests — requires PostgreSQL
pytest tests/integration/

# Single test
pytest tests/unit/test_auth.py::TestHashPassword::test_hash_password

# Full HTML coverage report
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html   # open htmlcov/index.html
```

Integration tests connect to `contact_verification_test`. Override the URL if your PostgreSQL is not on `localhost:5432`:

```bash
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://cvp_user:cvp_password@localhost:5432/contact_verification_test \
  pytest tests/integration/
```

```bash
cd frontend

npm test          # Vitest in watch mode (development)
npm run test:ci   # Single pass with coverage (used by CI)
```

**CI:** GitHub Actions runs three parallel jobs on every push and pull request to `main` — backend unit tests with coverage, backend integration tests against PostgreSQL and Redis service containers, and frontend lint / type-check / tests. Coverage reports are uploaded as workflow artefacts.

## Deployment (Render)

The application is deployed on Render's free tier:

| Service | Type | URL |
|---|---|---|
| `stillthere-frontend` | Static Site | https://stillthere-frontend.onrender.com |
| `stillthere-backend` | Web Service (Python) | https://stillthere-backend.onrender.com |
| Neon PostgreSQL | Serverless PostgreSQL | — (external, neon.tech) |
| Upstash Redis | External Redis | — (internal) |

**Key deployment details:**

- Alembic migrations run in the Start Command (`alembic upgrade head && uvicorn ...`) — not inside the FastAPI lifespan.
- Celery runs in the same Web Service dyno as uvicorn, started as a background process with `&` in the Start Command.
- `DATABASE_URL` is set manually in the Render dashboard to the **Neon connection string**. It is declared `sync: false` in `render.yaml` so Blueprint Syncs never overwrite it. Neon connection strings contain libpq-only parameters (`sslmode`, `channel_binding`) that asyncpg rejects — the `fix_database_url` validator in `config.py` strips them automatically and emits `ssl=require` instead.
- Neon's serverless compute auto-suspends after 5 minutes of inactivity, waking on the next query in ~1–2 seconds. A wakeup hint is shown on loading screens so users are aware during cold starts.
- Upstash Redis (free tier) supports only database 0. Both `REDIS_URL` and `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` must end in `/0`.
- `rediss://` URLs require explicit SSL configuration in `celery_app.py` (`broker_use_ssl` / `redis_backend_use_ssl`) — Kombu does not parse `?ssl_cert_reqs=CERT_NONE` from the URL string.
- `CORS_ORIGINS` must be a JSON array string: `["https://stillthere-frontend.onrender.com"]`.
